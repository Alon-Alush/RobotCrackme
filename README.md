# RobotCrackme


RobotCrackme is a mid-level crackme, aimed at reversers who already grasped the basic concepts of reverse engineering like unpacking and anti-debugging.

# The storyline

In the crackme, you basically have to help "Bob the Robot" find his passcode so that he could change his battery slot. Like my previous crackme, it adds ASCII art to make the cracking process more interesting and engaging.
